Since Oct,2012, after my travel back from Sweden I began to learn Swedish (Sveska in Sweidsh) using Rosetta Stone.
The philosophy of Rosetta Stone is called "Immersion", that is to say to learn a language in the same way as baby does: learning, practing, speaking and so on.
Thus no textbook is needed.
It's a new eperience for me. As a language fan and Chinese native speaker, I learned English and French in traditional school way: go to classes and learn the grammar. So Swedish is , the 2nd language I learn as a baby!
But it works really fine: I smoothly steps into Unit4 of Level 1 in rosetta stone, and learn the basic situations of conversations in Swedish. No need to look up in dictionary, it's really fun to guessing the meaning and hit the scores.


But today I meet a problem in grammar part. A lot of mistakes were made when asked to distinguish between "mer" and "fler".
In Swedish, the example is Mannen har ____ te 채n sin fru, the option is mer or fler?
According to the picture Rosetta shows, obviously the man is having more tea than his wife. But what is the difference between mer and fler?
I tried mer. YES! Green checker!
Then I continue with following questions: Flicka har ____ 채pplen 채n sin mamma.Guess still mer here? Click and get error a big red cross!

OK. So according to my English knowledge, it's highly possible that mer and fler is used for incountable nouns and countable nouns respectively.
To verify my assumption, google translate is used. When translating from Swedish to English, both mer and fler are "more". However, when I tried to translate from English to Swedish for the whole sentece like " The man has more tea than his wife" and "The girl has more apples than her mother", the mer and fler are used here. 

Then switch the nouns in google translate, like milk/oranges and so on. Bingo!
My guess is correct! Mer is used for uncoutable nouns such as milk, tea, juice , while fler is used for countable nouns such as books, apples, pens and so on.

One one more step: refer to a blog about Swedish Grammar. In the blog, the author tells the same story as my guess. Really get it!

I would never forget the difference between mer and fler: I've struggle to figure it out. That's the interesting part of immersion study.

OK. I'll go back to learn Svenska now. 
One more point: more : mer vs fler. less: mindre, fewer: f채rre
