Be back to update my blog here. A day to remember.

##Java training course
    This week is dedicated for java training, a 4 days course from Affix AB company.
    Have been an internal java course from @Honnix internally. But I have to amit that Honnix's course is intended for developers with previous Java development experience, and the course is designed to write codes with enhanced efficiency and better coding style. That course I attended in 2012(oops, 2 years ago already) is an advanced course instead of _start from dummy_.
    This Java course is instead, supposing that attendents have no previous of Java coding at all. Hmmm, that's quite good.
    One major part of this course is Eclipse training.As you might know, Eclipse is a powerful tool. However, a tool that is too powerful becomes weird for rookies to start with. I'm so glad to find such an step-by-step course, showing the basic functions to create/modify a new java project, as well as some tips for comment codes. 
    The course today mainly focus on Java introduction and syntax. 
    Exercise time occupies around 40% of the whole training time today. Successfully accomplish the code to guess an integer between 1-20 with user-defined code. Now the main function looks neat and clean.
    Code to be loaded (TBU).

    Really expecting the course tomorrow:)
