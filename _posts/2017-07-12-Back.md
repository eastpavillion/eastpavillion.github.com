    It was a long time since my last blog. A lot of things happened and now I think it is time to back to the blog recording habit.
	There are a few things to fix:
	
1)	Find the index file to list all the blogs under _post. (ongoing)
2)	Make a MAC command repository (Done)
3)	Download github desktop for Windows computer to avoid of the problem of speed. (Done)
4)	Find way to commit change from windows github desktop.(ongoing)
